*Types of errors: syntax, runtime, 
We gonna go through;
1. displaying text string variables
2. storing numbers 
3. working with dates and time 
4. making decision with code 
5. complex decision with code.
6. repeating events 
7. repeating events until done 
8. remembering list 
9. how to save information file 
10. reading from files 
11. functions 
12. handling errors

#the range() function has three paprameters: start, stop and step.
range(2, 15, 2)                      	
Output [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
#their is also count function, It is just to count number of variables -----.
count(var)

#Power function ================
pow(2,4) same as 2**4 same as 2 raise to power 4

#In Python we use, PEDMAS: Parenthesis, exponetial, division, multiply, addition, & subtract for mathematical operations
#using modules either maths or other
% means modulo 5%2=1 like remainder
#programmers find all functions either by intelligence, documentation and internet searches.
#Different formats to display numbers. for me I can say %d means no decimal and %f means there is decimal point.

#syntax--------------------------------output 
print 'i have %d cats' % 6      means i have 6 cats
print 'i have %03d cats' % 6    means   006cats
print 'i have %f cats' % 6      means i have 6.000000 cats.
print 'i have %.2f cats' % 6    means i have 6.00 cats

#Methods: let's say  yourface.punch() yourface is where you want to perform an action, punch is the action. 
#you can use \n to force a new line for strings and ordinary \ for numeric value
>> append add vairables
face.append(46)     simply instruct python to add 46 to whatever is in face
>> count, we talked about this earlier
face.count()
>> extend; adds two variables to one.
one.extend(two) 
>> index; numbering
say=['hey', 'ball', 'hello']
say.index ('ball')   
output = 1 
#Note, Python starts numbering from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 .......
print (say[0])         hey
say[0] = 'hello'
del say[0]
print (say[0])
say.insert(2, 'now')
>> pop; removes variable. similaly to remove method
say.pop(1)
>> reverse. say.reverse()


#sort and turple and find  method
#sort arrange variables in ascending order
new=[2,1,4,6,8,9,0,3]
new.sort()
sorted is used for strings.

strings n stuff.    %s= array
myself=('my name is %s, I am %s years old')
>>> varb=('Raji kudus Adewale', '19')
>>> print myself % varb
OUTPUT = my name is Raji kudus Adewale, I am 19 years old

#more on displaying string variables
>> str.lower()   #this gives a lowercase of the variable
and str.replace('a', 'b')   # this replace var a with var b

Dictionary store keys and values and its uses curly brackets {}

class={'dad':'70', 'mum':'67', 'sis':'35'}

>>> dic={'dad':30,'mom':29,'lisa':10}
>>> dic
{'dad': 30, 'lisa': 10, 'mom': 29}
>>> for key in dic:
	print key, dic[key]
OUTPUT = dad 30
	 lisa 10
	 mom 29
# If Statement (Conditioning)
if statement. uses == 
wale = 'fish'
if wale =='fish':
	print 'this fish is sweet'
elif wale=='cat':
	print 'wale is up to something'
else:
	print 'close case'

#comparison operators..... <, >, <=, >=, !=, ==
!= means not equal to.
'dog' < 'cat'
false

# For and While loop
#for and while loops.
# Simple task, looping b from 1 till <=10 
b = 1
>>> b
1
>>> while b <=10:
	print b
	b +=1


 gl=['bread','butter','egg','milk']      ------- this is a list not a dictionary
>>> gl
['bread', 'butter', 'egg', 'milk']
>>> for food in gl:
	print 'i want ' + food

i want bread 
i want butter
i want egg
i want milk



#challenge 1; Using input method, take in some parameters and form sentences.

name=raw_input('enter name: ')
place=raw_input('enter where he is living: ')
adjective=raw_input('qualify him with a word: ')
print 'the name of vice chancellor of federal university of technology akure is ' + name.capitalize() + n\ ',he is living at ' + place.capitalize() + ', his behaviour is ' + adjective.capitalize() + '.'

THE OUTPUT will tell you to input name, place, adjective, then hit enter

challenge 2; Calculate total distance covered by a car using s = (vt-ut)/2
v=input ('enter final velocity: ') 
u=input ('enter initial velocity: ')
t=input ('enter time taken: ')
totaldistance= (v*t-u*t)/2
print 'the total distance covered by the car is %.2f' % totaldistance + 'meters'

challenge 3
create a loan calculator
>>>#comment i wanna create a loan calculator
print 'welcome to Loan Calculator! never worry on how to get your monthly payment calculated'
l= input('please, kindly enter the cost of the loan you collected (loan amount): ')
i=input('please, what is the interest rate of the loan? may be 5% or 10% ')
n=input('yea, what is the number of years for the loan? ')
m= float(l*(i*(1+i)*n))/float((1+i)*n-1)
print 'using the above loan parameters, this user will be paying: %f' % m + \
      ' per month with the interest rate of %.2f' % i
